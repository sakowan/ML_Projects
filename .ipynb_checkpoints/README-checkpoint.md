# 🧑‍💻 Machine Learning Projects in PyTorch 🚀

Welcome to my repository! Here, I've created small machine learning models using **PyTorch**. These projects are a way for me to practice and solidify my understanding of machine learning concepts and techniques. 📚

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **PyTorch** for building and training models 🔧
- **Pandas** for data manipulation 📅
- **NumPy** for numerical operations ➗
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization 📊

## 🌟 Purpose
The goal of these projects is to strengthen my machine learning fundamentals. I’m creating and experimenting with these small models to enhance my understanding of how machine learning algorithms work in practice. 💪

## 🔍 Projects
In this repository, you'll find a range of models and experiments, including but not limited to:
- Classification models ⚖️
- Regression models 📈
- Neural networks 💻
... and more.
